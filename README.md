# Discord-Bot-E7
This Discord Bot was created using NodeJS, Google Sheets API, and DiscordJS API to help Epic 7 mobile game players to improve their guild war match ups by connecting their discord server with an in-depth Google Sheet.

# Getting Started
Start the bot using npm or nodemon bot.js in your terminal. Once the bot has logged in (e.g. Bot #1234 is ready!), the discord server will automatically pick up three letter strings with dashes in between them. The three names will populate into the Google Sheet and return back data on how to beat that specific team composition.

# Dependencies
- Node/Nodemon
- Google Sheets API
- DiscordJS API
